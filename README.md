Tiny program to open/close remote CD-ROM door using the [SubSeven](https://github.com/DarkCoderSc/SubSeven) UX framework.

‚ö†Ô∏è CD-ROM Required (Good luck).

I was flooded with pm/mails about implementing this legendary feature on SubSeven Legacy. Have fun üòÇ

As always, thanks to my UX designer (Lois) for the epic icon.
